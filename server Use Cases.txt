Use cases:

	Client joins lobby
	time between client and server packets calculated
	the client is given a unique ID
	a game time is sent to the client from the server calculating the time between them and a unique ID is given to the player
	client passes Entity (Player) and Event (new Player)
	the server receives the entity and ID’s it by the clients unique ID
	the server then sends the world to all the players
	client renders the entities it’s given and moves them to their positions


Server reads from world every tick and sends update to clients


	————————————————————————————
	optimal tick rate is dependent on the clients CPU and the bandwidth they have
